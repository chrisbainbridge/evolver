Plan from 30th September 2005

1. Get pole balancer simulation working again under new framework
[ Deadline: January 2006)

2. Implement LQR controller
[ Deadline: February 2006)

4. Pole balancer experiments, compare against LQR analytical solution.

   Averaging results over a suitable number of experiments, plot:

     number of quanta (x) against balance time (y).
     plot lines for avg, max, LQR

   This will show the performance cost of reducing the number of state.
   CPQ provides a baseline "perfect balancer".

   The task could be varied by changing the magnitude or regularity of
   the force hitting the pole. It is not clear whether it is better to
   present results like this separately, or to average and summarise in
   a single plot.

[ Deadline: March 2006)

6. Finish other digital network code (Cellular Automata, Random Boolean
Network, Digital circuits).
[ Deadline: May 2006)

7. Co-evolution experiments. Averaging results over a suitable number
of experiments, find mean/max performance of various tasks
(running, jumping, target chasing). Plots:

     * for quantised network: number of quanta (x) against performance (y). 
     * compare continuous, quantised, ca, rbn. For each plot the avg and
       max performance on each task of the best controller found after
       some number of experimental runs. 

[ Deadline: June 2006)

8. Writeup thesis.
[ Deadline: September 2006)


* "benchmark to judge significance of work"

** effects of reducing precision

** Properly studying evolved quantised controllers means investigating
questions like the following:
  - What happens when you reduce precision (= quantise)?
  - If this works (how well? need experiments with measurement) then
 within what limits (e.g. on number of bits) does it work well?
  - What is the relationship between evolved quantised control and
  evolved continuous control?  Between quantised evolutionary control
   and analytically-derived optimal control?
  - Pole-balancing is a good task for an exhaustive study, since it is
    so simple, but do your conclusions for that tasks extend to other
    tasks?
  - Pole balancer should be compared with LQR controller, which gives
 the ideal solution
- What about friction (see Matthew Whitaker's work)?  [Chris: not a
 problem]
 - Is there noise in the simulation?  [Chris: no, but could easily add
  noise to sensors]
  - What about different quantisation methods, other than linear
   quantisation?  You could even evolve the quantisation scheme.
   - How does it compare with a Boltzmann machine?  (The network looked
    similar to the BM.)
    - Look at work of Matthew Whitaker (MRes), Noah Keen (Chicago,
     ex-MSc), Joel Horne (UG project)

Nigel suggests that Chris should produce a document in the near future
describing his hypothesis and outlining the story that he will tell in
his thesis.
